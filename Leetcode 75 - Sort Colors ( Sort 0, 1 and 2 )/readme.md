# Sort Colors (LeetCode #75)

## ðŸ§© Problem Description

Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them **in-place** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order **red (0)**, **white (1)**, and **blue (2)**.

We use the integers:

- `0` to represent red,
- `1` to represent white,
- `2` to represent blue.

You **must not** use the built-in sort function â€” implement your own in-place sorting.
